# Heart Disease Prediction using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification algorithm implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It aims to provide a tool that can assist in early detection and diagnosis of heart disease based on given input features.

## Features

- Heart Disease Prediction: The project utilizes a KNN classifier to predict the presence or absence of heart disease based on several input features.
- K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm: The KNN algorithm is employed to classify the target variable by finding the k-nearest data points in the training set.
- Feature Selection: Relevant features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other medical attributes are considered to make accurate predictions.
- Model Evaluation: The project incorporates evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the performance of the trained KNN model.

## Dataset

The project employs a heart disease dataset that includes various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant information. The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set, enabling the model to learn from the training set and evaluate its performance on unseen data.
